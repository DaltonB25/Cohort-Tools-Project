Research day 1:
CORS - Cross-Origin Resource Sharing
*  If you try to make an HTTP request (using fetch, axios, or XMLHttpRequest) from an app/script running in the browser, the browser will block it by default.
* In order for the browser to permit an HTTP request, the origin of the client-side app must be whitelisted on the server and permitted by the server.
* CORS works like a firewall that only allows authorized connections from the browser to the server.
